However, Clauses 9.2 and 9.8, do not operate to negate any express refund obligations explicitly stated to be accepted by KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD in Clause 10.15.1.</p><p> Liability Limits</p><p> 9.3 Where any software, data, documents or service is expressed to be provided on an 'as is' basis, or where KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD has expressly excluded its liability for the respective issue, then subject to Clause 9.1, KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD accepts no liability in such circumstances.</p><p> 9.4 Subject to Clause 9.1, where any remedy is expressed to be a sole and exclusive remedy, then that respective remedy applies.</p><p> 9.5 In respect of all support or Service availability issues where the Customer has not elected the Premium Service, then Clause 6.11 applies;</p><p> 9.6 in respect of all support or Service availability issues where the Customer has elected the Premium Service, then the liability amount will be as expressly stated in the SLA;</p><p> 9.7 Subject to Clause 9.1, the liability limits in Clause 9.8 apply where:</p><p> 9.7.1 the liability is not limited or excluded within the scope of any of Clauses 9.2 to 9.6 (inclusive); or</p><p> 9.7.2 Clause 6.15 is applicable (in which case Clause 9.8.1 will be applicable).</p><p> 9.8 Subject to Clauses 9.1 to 9.7 (inclusive) and 9.14, the aggregate liability of KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD for all claims arising under or in connection with this Agreement (whether arising under contract (including without limitation in relation to any deliberate repudiatory and fundamental breaches), statute, tort (including without limitation, negligence), or otherwise) shall be limited as follows in respect of the issues for which KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD is found liable:</p><p> 9.8.1 in respect of the totality of all issues with the Software Materials, Services, Premium Service and Service Output, where the causes giving rise to the liability on the part of KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD occur within a particular Year, to a total aggregate amount of that respective Year's paid amounts by the Customer to KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD (the <strong>"Liability Cap"</strong>) (for the avoidance of doubt, any amount spent from a Credit whether in the same or a different Year, will not constitute an additional amount of charges for the purposes of this Clause, as the purchase of the Credit counts towards the 'paid amounts' by the Customer to KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD, and therefore spending of Credits does not count, to avoid double-counting)), with such Liability Cap limiting KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD's collective liability for the totality of all such issues within that Year (and for the avoidance of doubt, if there are two issues within a Year, then the aggregate liability of KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD arising in respect of such 2 issues collectively, would equate to 100% of the charges paid in that respective Year and not 200% of the charges paid in that respective Year); or</p><p> 9.8.2 in respect of the totality of all liability for collectively all other issues arising under or in connection with this Agreement, which are notlimited by Clause 9.8.1, nor limited or excluded by any other provision of this Agreement, to the aggregate amount of &#163;100 (the <strong>"Additional Liability Cap"</strong>).</p><p> 9.9 If the Customer has not paid any amounts invoiced in a particular Year, but suffers an issue in that Year</p><p> for which KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD is liable, then for the purposes of Clause 9.8.1, the 'Liability Cap' for the current Year will equate to the greater of:</p><p> 9.9.1 &#163;100; or</p><p> 9.9.2 the total amount paid by the Customer to KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD in the immediately preceding Year.</p><p> Customer's Acknowledgment</p><p> 9.10 The Customer acknowledges that the charges in respect of this Agreement have been calculated on the basis that KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD will exclude and limit its liability as set out in this Agreement, and that the limitations and exclusions of liability in this Agreement are therefore reasonable.</p><p> 9.11 Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary (but subject to Clause 9.1):</p><p> 9.11.1 the exclusions of liability in Clause 9 prevail; and</p><p> 9.11.2 KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD's liability under or in connection with this Agreement will not exceed the limits referred to in Clause 9; and</p><p> 9.11.3 where the Agreement refers to any limitation or exclusion of liability of KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD, such limitation or exclusion applies whether the respective liability arises under contract (including without limitation in relation to any deliberate repudiatory and fundamental breaches), statute, tort (including without limitation, negligence), or otherwise.</p><p> Limitation Time Period</p><p> 9.12 The Customer acknowledges that any claims which it wishes to pursue against KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD will be raised promptly. The Parties therefore agree that KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD shall not be held liable for any liability in respect of events occurring during the term of this Agreement, where the respective claim is not brought through legal proceedings against KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD within 12 months following the earlier of: (1) when the event giving rise to the cause of action arose; and (2) termination of the Agreement.</p><p> Consequences For Exhaustion Of Liability Limits</p><p> 9.13 The Parties agree that either Party may terminate the Agreement for convenience, if the Liability Cap or Additional Liability Cap becomes exhausted by the Customer successfully bringing claims against KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD (which are determined by a Court, or agreed between the Parties, as owing) for at least the total amount of the Liability Cap or the Additional Liability Cap. In such circumstances, such termination of itself will not give rise to any additional remedies nor refund rights.</p><p> Customer's Additional Obligations In Respect Of Wrongful Actions</p><p> 9.14 The Customer agrees that it will be liable for all amounts to (whether arising in respect of any or all of the following circumstances):</p><p> 9.14.1 KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD and the Licensors in respect of, and relating to, any claim made against, or loss incurred or suffered by, KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD and/or the Licensors where this is wholly or in part attributable directly or indirectly to the Customer breaching any of the provisions of the Third Party Contracts. Furthermore, the Customer agrees that if KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD is required to pay any sums to any third party as a result of the Customer breaching any of the Third Party Contracts, then the Customer will, immediately upon notice, reimburse KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD in full with the amount which KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD has had to pay to such third party as a result;</p><p> 9.14.2 KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD in respect of any breaches of KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD's or its third parties' intellectual property rights (including without limitation, copyright and trademarks); and</p><p> 9.14.3 KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD for any breaches of the Agreement which are undertaken with the deliberate intention of breaching this Agreement (with the Customer being deemed to be aware of all of the provisions of this Agreement).</p><p> 10 Term, Termination and Suspension</p><p> Duration</p><p> 10.1 The Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and continue in force until it is terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement.</p><p> 10.2 The licences granted to use the respective Services pursuant to the Agreement (either for use of the respective Services or any Software Materials) will be valid for the shorter of the following respective periods:</p><p> 10.2.1 the expiration of the respective Subscription Period; or</p><p> 10.2.2 where the use is granted subject to Credit, until such Credit expires through time or use as appropriate; or</p><p> 10.2.3 the specified period in the Account Section or invoice (or as otherwise agreed between the Parties in writing); or</p><p> 10.2.4 the termination of the Agreement.</p><p> Temporary Suspension Of Service</p><p> 10.3 KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD may temporarily suspend:</p><p> 10.3.1 the Service; and/or</p><p> 10.3.2 making available any of the Software Materials;</p><p> for emergency or urgent operational reasons, but where reasonably practicable, it will give the Customer advance warning of such suspension.</p><p> Suspension For Abnormal Use</p><p> 10.4 If KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD reasonably believes that the Customer's abnormal use of the Service or Software Materials is impairing the Service's performance or resulting in abnormal Credit consumption (as reasonably determined by KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD), then KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD may suspend the Customer's access until the cause of the impairment has been resolved (such suspension will not affect the Customer's requirement to continue paying the relevant charges for the suspended Service or Software Materials, nor will it extend the respective Subscription Period in respect of any Credit).</p><p> Termination Or Suspension by KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD</p><p> 10.5 KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD will have the right to suspend or terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice (however, suspension will occur automatically following email notification if any payment is not made by the respective due date by the Customer) if the Customer fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement (such suspension will not affect the Customer's requirement to continue paying the relevant charges for the suspended Service or Premium Service (as applicable), nor will it extend the respective Subscription Period in respect of any Credit; termination of the Agreement in such circumstances will also not entitle the Customer to any refund).</p><p> 10.6 KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD may terminate the Agreement (in whole or in part) immediately upon notice to the Customer at any time, if:</p><p> 10.6.1 KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD is no longer able to make available the Service or Software Materials (in whole or in part) due to the acts or omissions of the Licensors;</p><p> 10.6.2 any of the Third Party Contracts terminate for any reason;</p><p> 10.6.3 the Licensors vary their terms and conditions, requirements, or pricing in a manner which adversely affects KRYPTOS SYSTEMS LTD or the Customer;</p><p> 10.6.4 a Licensor claims that the use of the Database or the Softw]]></target>

The information requested within these sections is standard and includes name, address, phone number and email details and is collected for the purpose of administering your account (this will therefore include: registering your account; processing any orders which you make; communicating with you on any matter relating to the conduct of your account; and the provision of our services to you in general).</p><p> Where we are undertaking any services in collaboration with a third party (this will be clear from either the branding or notices on the website), then we may be required in order to provide the respective services, to share your account details with such third party in order to administrate the account (in a similar manner as mentioned above) and provide the respective services.</p><p> We will also need to share details about your use of our services with our data licensors and authorised resellers, with such details including the number of users and volume of transactions, so that appropriate licence fees and other payments can be calculated.</p><p> We may also use aggregate information and statistics for the purposes of monitoring website usage in order to help us develop the website and our services. These statistics will not include information that can be used to identify any individual.</p><p> We may also wish to provide you with information about special features of our website or any other service or products we think may be of interest to you. If you would rather not receive this information, you will have the opportunity on our website at the time of registration to make this clear, and subsequently if you change your mind you can send an email with such a request to support@kryptossystems.co.uk.</p><p> <strong>Email addresses</strong></p><p> We collect email addresses for 3 main purposes.</p><ul type="disc"> <li> Email is our preferred means of communication, and will be used to notify our customers of developments within the Kryptos Systems services. </li><li> We use email to administer your account, for example, by alerting you when your account balance reaches a given level. </li><li> The email address on registration will be used to authenticate users who have forgotten passwords or user account IDs. </li></ul><p> <strong>Where We Process Your Personal Data</strong></p><p> Although we process your data within the European Economic Area ("EEA"), owing to the global nature of the Internet infrastructure, the information you provide may be transferred in transit to other countries outside the EEA that do not have similar protections in place as the EEA regarding your data and its use as set out in this policy. By submitting your information you consent to such transfers outside the EEA.</p><p> We may also have third party companies providing hosting services for us. Such third party companies will act as our subcontractors, and they would hold your data for such hosting purposes only. Such subcontractors will not be provided with any permission for any other use or disclosure of your data. We will also ensure that we have reasonable safeguards in place with regard to any of our subcontractors, with regard to data retention and security.</p><p> <strong>Compliance &amp; Confidentiality</strong></p><p> Our company complies with its obligations under the applicable data protection legislation in England. It will also take reasonable care to prevent any unauthorised access to your personal data.</p><p> Our employees and contractors have been made aware of their responsibility to keep your information confidential.</p><p> <strong>Security</strong></p><p> As you will probably be aware, the internet is not a secure medium. However we have put in place various security procedures by way of reasonable measures to protect your information.</p><p> We consider the security of your personal data and the details of any transactions you make to be a matter of the highest priority.</p><p> Your account information is protected by your account code and password which you should keep safe at all times. In addition to your password, we generate keys which are used to authenticate your account against our servers when you are querying the database. Keys are a randomly generated and unique set of letters and numbers.</p><p> If you feel that there has been a breach in the security on your licence please contact us by email at security@kryptossystems.co.uk.</p><p> <strong>Purchasing</strong></p><p> When you place an order with us, we use a secure server. Any data you provide to us, is encrypted using a 'Secure Socket Layer' (SSL) session. SSL is an industry standard and is a widely used measure to guard against Internet messages being intercepted. You should be aware, however, that older browsers cannot use SSL. To be sure, you will need Netscape version 4.05 or above, Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4 or above, or any similar generation browser (e.g. Firefox, Opera).</p><p> Although your account can be set up to make repeat purchases to automatically top-up your account by credit card, we do not actually store credit card details. We only hold the last 4 digits of your card, the card holder name and a reference to the last transaction made on that card from us. It is the transaction reference that is used to make repeat purchases and this can only be used between ourselves and our payment service provider, SagePAY.</p><p> <strong>Protecting your data</strong></p><p> Over and above what our company does to protect your privacy and security, we would advise you to adopt the following additional measures:</p><ul type="disc"> <li> Choose a password you can remember but others will not guess. </li><li> Change your password regularly, and if you do write it down, keep it somewhere safe and secure. </li><li> Do not activate Autocomplete (Internet Explorer) or any similar feature. </li><li> Do not allow your internet browser to 'remember' passwords. </li><li> When you have finished your session on our website we recommend that you close your browser, so any history of the session is cleared. As a further security measure our website will automatically shut down your session if it is not used for more than 20 minutes. </li><li> Clear any 'cache' so there is no record of any transactions left on screen - all major web browsers let you do this. </li></ul><p> <strong>Use of cookies</strong></p><p> Our website creates a cookie every time you access the website.
